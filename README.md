## Running the server

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
